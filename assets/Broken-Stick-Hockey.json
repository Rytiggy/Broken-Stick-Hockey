It was a great way to meet friends and get involved in a community of like minded people. When I moved home to Buffalo, I felt we were lacking that style of pick-up hockey. I created this company with hopes of bringing that type of community to my home town and providing Buffalo&#39;s players with a great pick-up experience.&quot;<br><br></p></section>",

These are just loose guidelines, every player excels at a different rate. The best way to see if you are a good fit for this level is by playing!
